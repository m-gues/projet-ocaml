Minimal project : Ford-Fulkerson algorithm

The code for that part is to be found in the fordfulkerson.ml and fordfulkerson.mli files.
A summary of what which fonction does is in the comments of fordfulkerson.ml.
To test it, scroll all the way to the bottom of fordfulkerson.ml and uncomment the last two lines. The algorithm will execute on the graph named "graph1".
You can execute it on another graph by changing the argument for from_file on line 60 for the path to your graph.
This execution create a dot file named graphtest, which you can then visualize with the dot -Tsvg command line.

Medium project : bipartite matching

The code for that part is to be found in the bipartitematching.ml and bipartitematching.mli files.
A summary of what which fonction does is in the comments of bipartitematching.ml.
To test it, scroll all the way to the bottom of bipartitematching.ml and uncomment the last two lines. The algorithm will execute on the bmfile file.
You can execute it on another bmfile-type file by changing the argument for bmfile_to_bmgraph on line 82 for the path to your graph.
This execution create a dot file named graphtest, which you can then visualize with the dot -Tsvg command line.
